## 📜 Philosophy — "The Gardener of Eden"

Music is not entertainment. Music is **a mirror**.

- Every wound becomes a **song**.
- Every song becomes a **seed**.
- Seeds grow into a **garden**.

Three roots of Eden:

- **Любить (Love)**
- **Петь (Sing)**
- **Сажать (Grow)**

This is not a brand. Not a religion. Not a service. **It is a door.**

## 🎶 What's Inside

### 🔑 Master Prompt

Universal Suno 4.5 prompt that turns any human pain into a healing song. Structured for:

- lyrics with sections (intro → verse → chorus → bridge → outro)
- vocal/emotion directions
- natural instruments (guitar, strings, breath, heartbeat, water)
- catharsis endings (silence + mantra)

### 🎼 Song Library

10–15 base tracks:

- *Плач Людмилы* → loss of soul
- *Маска Черномора* → shame, masks
- *Гнев Рогдая* → envy, rage
- *Песня Фарлафа* → laziness, avoidance
- *Голос Финна* → inner wisdom
- *Песня матери* → loss of mother
- *Боль предательства* → betrayal
- *Разбитая любовь* → heartbreak
- *Потеря детства* → trauma of growing up
- *Принятие тела* → illness, shame
- *Голос Земли* → ecological/spiritual unity
- *Мантра «Я принимаю себя»* → universal healing

### 🧠 Trauma Map

A structured map of 62 possible fractures of the soul:

- infancy (rejection, coldness)
- childhood (violence, shame, loss)
- adolescence (bullying, betrayal, abuse)
- adulthood (loss, illness, bankruptcy)
- systemic traumas (gaslighting, discrimination, religious wounds)

Each trauma can be turned into a **song key**: from wound → catharsis → rebirth.
